<h4 style="color: #ee794d; font-size: 18px;">Soho’s International Food Tour</h4>
<p>Our Soho International Food Tour is an exploration of one of London’s most diverse and historically rich neighborhoods, Soho. </p>
<h4 style="color: #ee794d; font-size: 18px;">Discover Soho</h4>
<p>Soho, London’s premier neighborhood for entertainment, is filled with pubs, bakeries, bars, restaurants & coffee shops.  From the traditional to some of the newest fusions in the city, Soho is the place to learn about London’s incredible International Food scene. </p>
    
<p>Our 4.5-hour tour will start at the meeting point in Soho. After a brief introduction, you will begin your exploration of Soho with breakfast tasting, at an exclusive, little diner.  </p>

<p>From there, you will wander down one historical street after another, stopping for a variety of delicious international food tastings as Italian, Indian, Chinese and Mexican food, along with  local food tastings in a famous English Pub – one of the five oldest in London, where you’ll sit back and relax with a traditional British ale-tasting accompanied by a tasting of their famous fish and chips and tastings different types of beer, while learning about the importance of pubs in British culture.</p>

<p>After a very exclusive dessert in a secret location, it is time for the final tasting at an old underground bar London for an international wine tasting. </p>

<h4 style="color: #ee794d; font-size: 18px;">Feel Like a Local</h4>

<p>Our tour aims to give you the local feel of Soho and all it has to offer.Soho folklore is rich with colorful stories of writers, poets, artists and historical figures. It has been a landmark that influenced many artists, as well. It’s easy to walk around Soho and enjoy the vibrant atmosphere, but we want to also show you the layers underneath, that are not always visible to the eye.</p>

<p>Our tour will take you through some of Soho’s most historically interesting streets, as we try a wide variety of International Foods from some of our favorite places in Soho. </p>

<p>Don’t eat breakfast before this tour, as it fully includes breakfast, lunch and many snacks in between. </p>

<h4 style="color: #ee794d; font-size: 18px;">Multi-Cultural Influences = Amazing International Cuisine</h4>

<p>The Theme of our Soho Food tour is “International Foods”, because Soho is considered one of London’s oldest multicultural areas. From the time of its development in the late 1600s, the rich never looked upon Soho as favorably as the other luxury boroughs. Immigrants moved in, and Soho initially became known as London’s “French Quarter”. 
Most foreigners that came to London, found cheap housing in Soho, and brought with them their incredible cuisines. Amidst the music halls, small theatres and brothels, these immigrants opened up cheap “eating-houses” all over the neighborhood, making it the “in” place to eat for intellectuals, writers and artists, looking for delicious international cuisine.</p>

<p>Your exploration of Soho, will bring to life layer up on layer of Soho’s rich history, and highlight the cultures that have brought so many of London’s diverse foods – often Soho being the first place to find them.</p>

We had just the right amount of food to keep us happy but wanting more and it was so much fun that when it was over we did not want to go home,  so we just carried on!<span class="quote1">”</span>

               <span class="quote1">“</span> Who said you can't teach an old dog new tricks? I'll tell you who can, the team at "London Food Lovers"!! I have to say this was a gastronomic jamboree peppered with facts and fun. We visited a number of fantastic establishments whom offered great hospitality and golden nuggets of their culinary skills. The tour was very well organised and insightful. Just when you think you know it all you get a wonderful surprise, I felt like I'd toured the planet with dishes and refreshments from sunny Hawaii to the backstreets of Taiwan.....not leaving out indigenous London culinary delights such as a fabulous fish n chips with a selection of ales! My advice....book your ticket and do not..I repeat, do not eat a morsel before you go!<span class="quote1">”</span>

             <p>   <span class="quote1">“</span> My husband and I had a blast on London Food Lovers Tour.
It was fun walking around the Soho and sampling the unique foods from all the diffrent restaurants.
Our tour guide Sarah was very informative and friendly. Our tour included wine testing, amazing food( we tried food cooked to perfection), tee tasting and some yummy desserts absolutely DELICIOUS!!! we were pleasantly full by the end of the tour, the portions were just right at each restaurant we visited. </p> <p> We loved learning about history behind the restaurants and recipes from the owners, bakers and chiefs. 
All the other tour guests were friendly foodies and it was fun getting to know all of them!
It was perfect day for me and my husband, we can't recommend it enough!!!
There's no doubt London Food Lovers will quickly become the hotest tour in town!!!!  <span class="quote1">”</span> </p>

<span class="quote1">“</span> This was by far one of the greatest experiences I've had in London.
The food on this tour was delicious, and carefully selected to ensure a gastronomic feast that engaged all the senses. What really blew me away though -not being a resolute "foodie" or anythng, just knowing a bit about the pleasures of dining and living in a country that holds food at a higher standard+ mixes it in with the way of life - was the cultural aspect!! very unexpected…I thought this tour would be something fun to fill my time in London, but it went above and beyond my expectations of merely 'sampling food' like I thought…
</p>

<p>Instead, not only did we eat some of the most creative and appetizing food I've ever had (all the while swinging from street casual to sophisticated venues to appreciate variety) but the Director of the tour Sara (so knowledgeable and lovely!!) ensured a real educational experience of Soho, telling us the most interesting stories and filling in our historical blanks about a diverse neighbourhood that has become one of the most vibrant, provocative and stimulating areas of central London. I don't want to give anything away (i also don't usually leave such long reviews!) but I can't recommend this tour enough… It was entertaining, interesting, exquisite and so different from any tour (food or otherwise) I've ever been on. 

    <p>I will DEFINITELY be checking out other tours/locations by Food Lovers in the future. I think whether you're already a food lover or not, this tour Will open you up to new worlds (even a couple of Londoners in the group were surprised at the places they discovered!). As an added bonus -and maybe we were just lucky- the atmosphere and general vibe in our group was great, and many of us swapped emails at the end. I've been on tours where you dread having to interact with the group you were placed in, but I think Sara's professionalism coupled with her fun and light approach really set the course and put us all at ease from the very first moment. Anyway, I will definitely be going back to a few of those little gems next time I'm in London. THANK YOU SO MUCH!!  <span class="quote1">”</span></p>

It was great to see that even living in the city for 7 years you able to discover so many amazing places with great history and quality. The diversity that London offers, makes every stop a new discovery and with a great guidance you have the opportunity to find out what the city can really offer. I highly recommend as a great choice of activity for a weekend in the city, something interesting and different to do with family or as a work get together, it just offers options for all tastes and ages.<span class="quote1">”</span>

culture, but also to TASTE the area you are visiting. Sarah takes 

you along a lovely walk of the very cool district of Soho - she 

tells you neat historical tidbits and tales all the while enjoying 

unique delicious foods! I am salivating for the next time I can 

take another tour with Sarah and the team! Thank you all for a
