<h4 style="color: #ee794d; font-size: 18px;">Soho’s International Food Tour</h4>
<p>Our Soho International Food Tour is an exploration of one of London’s most diverse and historically rich neighborhoods, Soho. </p>
<h4 style="color: #ee794d; font-size: 18px;">Discover Soho</h4>
<p>Soho, London’s premier neighborhood for entertainment, is filled with pubs, bakeries, bars, restaurants & coffee shops.  From the traditional to some of the newest fusions in the city, Soho is the place to learn about London’s incredible International Food scene. </p>
    
<p>Our 4.5-hour tour will start at the meeting point in Soho. After a brief introduction, you will begin your exploration of Soho with breakfast tasting, at an exclusive, little diner.  </p>

<p>From there, you will wander down one historical street after another, stopping for a variety of delicious international food tastings as Italian, Indian, Chinese and Mexican food, along with  local food tastings in a famous English Pub – one of the five oldest in London, where you’ll sit back and relax with a traditional British ale-tasting accompanied by a tasting of their famous fish and chips and tastings different types of beer, while learning about the importance of pubs in British culture.</p>

<p>After a very exclusive dessert in a secret location, it is time for the final tasting at an old underground bar London for an international wine tasting. </p>

<h4 style="color: #ee794d; font-size: 18px;">Feel Like a Local</h4>

<p>Our tour aims to give you the local feel of Soho and all it has to offer.Soho folklore is rich with colorful stories of writers, poets, artists and historical figures. It has been a landmark that influenced many artists, as well. It’s easy to walk around Soho and enjoy the vibrant atmosphere, but we want to also show you the layers underneath, that are not always visible to the eye.</p>

<p>Our tour will take you through some of Soho’s most historically interesting streets, as we try a wide variety of International Foods from some of our favorite places in Soho. </p>

<p>Don’t eat breakfast before this tour, as it fully includes breakfast, lunch and many snacks in between. </p>

<h4 style="color: #ee794d; font-size: 18px;">Multi-Cultural Influences = Amazing International Cuisine</h4>

<p>The Theme of our Soho Food tour is “International Foods”, because Soho is considered one of London’s oldest multicultural areas. From the time of its development in the late 1600s, the rich never looked upon Soho as favorably as the other luxury boroughs. Immigrants moved in, and Soho initially became known as London’s “French Quarter”. 
Most foreigners that came to London, found cheap housing in Soho, and brought with them their incredible cuisines. Amidst the music halls, small theatres and brothels, these immigrants opened up cheap “eating-houses” all over the neighborhood, making it the “in” place to eat for intellectuals, writers and artists, looking for delicious international cuisine.</p>

<p>Your exploration of Soho, will bring to life layer up on layer of Soho’s rich history, and highlight the cultures that have brought so many of London’s diverse foods – often Soho being the first place to find them.</p>
